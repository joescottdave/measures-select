Object-oriented approach to selecting the default measure from a [hydrology station](https://environment.data.gov.uk/hydrology/id/stations) intent is to build a Vue component that handles the selection of options and receiving of result.

## Development

`yarn install` dependencies and `yarn run vitest` to run the tests.
